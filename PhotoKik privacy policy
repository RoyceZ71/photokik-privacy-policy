    <h1>PhotoKik Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <div class="last-updated">
        <strong>Last updated:</strong> August 6, 2025
    </div>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how PhotoKik ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "Service"). PhotoKik is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your photos remain under your complete control.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik is designed with <strong>privacy by design</strong>. We process your photos locally on your device and do not collect, store, or transmit your personal photos to our servers. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your photos remain on your device at all times</li>
        <li>We do not upload or sync your photos to any cloud service</li>
        <li>We do not collect personal information or create user accounts</li>
        <li>App settings are stored locally on your device only</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics services</li>
        <li>No personal data is transmitted to external servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik processes your photos locally on your device for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Photo organization and categorization using on-device AI</li>
        <li>Duplicate detection and management</li>
        <li>Blur detection for quality assessment</li>
        <li>Providing the swipe-to-organize interface</li>
        <li>Generating photo statistics and organization insights</li>
        <li>Enabling the "Keep" or "Kik" photo management system</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All processing happens entirely on your device. No personal data is shared with third parties or transmitted to external services.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your privacy and data security are our top priorities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All photo processing happens locally on your device using device capabilities</li>
        <li>Your photos never leave your device through our app</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings are stored in your device's secure local storage</li>
        <li>We have no access to your photos, settings, or any personal information</li>
        <li>No PhotoKik servers store or process your personal data</li>
        <li>Photo metadata analysis is performed locally without external communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Permissions We Request</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik requests the following device permissions to function properly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> To take new photos within the app and access camera functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Photos/Gallery Access:</strong> To read, organize, and manage your existing photo library</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Access:</strong> To save organized photos and maintain app functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for the app's core photo management functionality. You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings, though this will limit the app's ability to organize your photos.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik operates as a <span class="highlight">100% offline application</span> for photo processing. We do not integrate with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Third-party analytics services</li>
        <li>Advertising networks or trackers</li>
        <li>Social media platforms</li>
        <li>Cloud storage services</li>
        <li>External AI or machine learning services</li>
        <li>Marketing or user behavior tracking tools</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik is suitable for all ages and is COPPA compliant. Since we don't collect any personal information from users of any age, there are no special considerations or additional protections needed for users under 13. Parents can safely allow children to use PhotoKik knowing that no personal data is collected or transmitted.</p>

    <h2>7. International Users & Data Processing</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik processes all data locally on your device, regardless of your geographic location. Since no data is transmitted to servers in any jurisdiction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GDPR compliance: No personal data processing on external servers</li>
        <li>CCPA compliance: No sale or sharing of personal information</li>
        <li>No cross-border data transfers occur</li>
        <li>Local data processing laws apply as appropriate to your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal compliance reasons. When we make changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy</li>
        <li>Significant changes will be communicated through app store update notes</li>
        <li>Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>Since PhotoKik operates entirely on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You have complete control over your photos at all times</li>
        <li>You can delete the app and all associated data at any time</li>
        <li>No external data deletion requests are needed</li>
        <li>You control all permissions through your device settings</li>
        <li>Your privacy rights are automatically protected by our offline design</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>PhotoKik employs the following security practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No network communication for photo processing</li>
        <li>Secure local storage using device encryption capabilities</li>
        <li>No user authentication or account systems to compromise</li>
        <li>Regular security updates through app store releases</li>

    </ul>
